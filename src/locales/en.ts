  // FAQ Questions and Answers
  faqWhatIsRecapHorizon: "What is RecapHorizon and how does it work?",
    faqWhatIsRecapHorizonAnswer: "RecapHorizon is an AI-powered tool that automatically records, transcribes and analyzes your meetings, webinars and conversations.

All data remains local on your device for complete privacy.",
  faqFileFormats: "What file formats can I upload?",
  faqFileFormatsAnswer: "RecapHorizon supports TXT, PDF, RTF, HTML, Markdown and DOCX files. PDF, RTF and DOCX are automatically converted to plain text. For best results, we recommend TXT files, but all formats are supported.",
  faqDocxImport: "How does DOCX import work?",
  faqDocxImportAnswer: "DOCX files are automatically converted to plain text when you upload them. The text is extracted from the document and can then be analyzed by our AI. Formatting like bold text, tables, and images are lost during conversion, but the text content is preserved.",
  faqRecordingLength: "How long can I record?",
  faqRecordingLengthAnswer: "The maximum length of recordings depends on your chosen subscription. The AI processes everything in real-time and generates results as soon as you stop recording.",

  faqAIAnalyses: "What types of analyses can AI generate?",
  faqAIAnalysesAnswer: "The AI can generate summaries, FAQs, key learnings, follow-up questions, sentiment analysis, keyword analysis, mindmaps, executive summaries, business cases, storytelling and quiz questions. Each analysis is tailored to your specific content.",
  faqAIAccuracy: "How accurate are the AI summaries?",
  faqAIAccuracyAnswer: "The AI summaries are very accurate and take into account the context of your conversation. They automatically identify important points, decisions and action items. The quality improves as the transcription becomes clearer.",
  faqAIQuestions: "Can I ask the AI questions about my transcript?",
  faqAIQuestionsAnswer: "Yes! You can chat with your transcript by asking questions. The AI understands the context and provides detailed answers. You can also use speech to ask questions.",
  faqLanguageSupport: "What languages does RecapHorizon support?",
  faqLanguageSupportAnswer: "RecapHorizon supports 64 languages for both input (transcription) and output (AI analysis). You can record a Dutch conversation and generate a summary in English, for example. Supported languages include Dutch, English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and many more.",

  storyTitle: "Our Story",
  storyContent: `The Story of RecapHorizon: Beyond the Chaos

Do you recognize that feeling after an intensive meeting, an engaging webinar, or an important conversation with your colleague? That fuzzy aftermath where you try to reconstruct: "What exactly did we discuss? What were the concrete agreements? And, oh yes, were there also follow-up actions?" It was this shared, universal frustration – the everyday chaos of communication – that brought together a small team of visionaries. They later called themselves, very appropriately, the "RecapHorizon team".

Their first thought was simple yet revolutionary: there had to be a way to capture and structure the essence of every conversation, regardless of the medium. Whether it was a noisy brainstorming session around a coffee table, a formal online meeting, or an ad-hoc phone call, they wanted a program that would help us record and summarize a meeting. The beginning was rudimentary, a rough diamond that needed to take shape.

Soon the ambition grew beyond just meetings. The chaos wasn't limited to the boardroom after all. Imagine: you're following a complex webinar, bursting with valuable information. What if you could summarize and analyze that directly, without spending hours taking notes? The need for a tool that could not only summarize meetings but also distill a recently followed webinar directly into usable insights quickly became the next milestone.

And then accessibility. A powerful tool is useless if it's not always and everywhere available. The vision expanded: not just on your PC, but especially also on your smartphone. The dream was crystal clear: "Press a button on your smartphone, put it down, and let the conversation be fully automated into a structured overview." It had to be seamless, an intuitive extension of your daily workflow.

What the RecapHorizon team made immediately clear, however, was that their focus was absolutely not on recording and storing audio or video. In fact, this raw data is deleted immediately after processing. Privacy and efficiency were paramount; it was purely about transforming fleeting spoken language into concrete, tangible insights. It was the essence, the 'recap', that mattered, not the carrier.

The ultimate goal was to, hand in hand with advanced AI, get the most out of the data. Depending on the recording and the user's needs, RecapHorizon had to easily let them choose what they wanted to see. One time a concise summary, another time an in-depth sentiment analysis, or a list of concrete follow-up actions. The user was the director, AI the invisible assistant that kneaded the data into the desired output.

This evolution, from a simple frustration to an ambitious vision, culminated in the creation of a robust web-app. This finally made the promise of 'everywhere and always accessible' true. Regardless of device or location, RecapHorizon was ready.

The RecapHorizon team was realistic. They knew they certainly weren't the first tool that could do this. The market was already full of various solutions. But where many competitors were complex, had a high threshold, and came with a price tag of 15 to 35 euros per month per user, RecapHorizon wanted something different. It was a tool built from the user, with the promise of accessibility for everyone. Costs were kept as low as possible, to offer a low-threshold alternative that everyone could always use, without pain in the wallet. They believed that the power of insight shouldn't be reserved for the elite, but should be available to everyone.

Today, the RecapHorizon team is proud of what they have achieved: a powerful, intuitive, and affordable solution that transforms the chaos of communication into clear insights. But the journey is far from over. Their notebooks are full of new ideas, and the drive to make communication even smarter and more efficient burns brighter than ever. The next steps are already in mind, all aimed at further empowering the user.
