# User Journey Flow Documentation

This document describes the complete user journey in RecapHorizon from initial website visit through subscription management and cancellation.

## Overview

The user journey consists of several key phases:
1. **Discovery Phase**: New user visits website and attempts login
2. **Waitlist Phase**: User joins waitlist when account creation is restricted
3. **Activation Phase**: Admin activates waitlist user (external process)
4. **Onboarding Phase**: User creates account and becomes free user
5. **Usage Phase**: User utilizes free tier for 4 weeks with limited usage
6. **Upgrade Phase**: User upgrades to Silver subscription
7. **Management Phase**: User manages and cancels subscription

## Detailed User Journey

### Phase 1: Discovery - New User Website Visit

**User Action**: New user visits RecapHorizon website
- User sees homepage with login/signup options
- User attempts to login without existing account

**System Response**: 
- General error message displayed ("User not found" or similar)
- No specific information revealed about email existence for security

**Technical Details**:
- Login attempt triggers authentication check in Firebase Auth
- Error handling in `App.tsx` `handleLogin` function
- Generic error messages prevent email enumeration attacks

### Phase 2: Account Creation Attempt

**User Action**: User tries to create new account
- User clicks "Create Account" or similar option
- User enters email and password

**System Response**:
- General message: "User not known" or "Account creation restricted"
- User directed to waitlist signup

**Technical Details**:
- Account creation restricted by default
- Firestore rules prevent unauthorized account creation
- Error handling redirects to waitlist modal

### Phase 3: Waitlist Registration

**User Action**: User joins waitlist
- User opens waitlist modal (`WaitlistModal.tsx`)
- User enters email address
- User submits waitlist form

**System Response**:
- Email and app language stored in Firestore
- Confirmation message displayed
- User notified about admin approval process

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// In App.tsx - addToWaitlist function
const addToWaitlist = async (email: string) => {
  // Email validation and duplicate check
  // Store in Firestore 'waitlist' collection:
  {
    email: email,
    language: uiLang, // Current app language
    status: 'pending',
    createdAt: new Date(),
    hashedEmail: hashedEmail // For security
  }
}
```

**Database Structure**:
```
waitlist/
├── {hashedEmail1}
│   ├── email: "user@example.com"
│   ├── language: "en" | "nl" | "fr" | "de" | "es" | "pt"
│   ├── status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected"
│   ├── createdAt: Timestamp
│   └── hashedEmail: string
```

### Phase 4: Admin Activation (External Process)

**Admin Action**: Admin reviews and activates waitlist users
- Admin accesses Firebase Console or admin panel
- Admin reviews pending waitlist entries
- Admin changes status from "pending" to "approved"

**System Changes**:
- Waitlist entry status updated to "approved"
- User becomes eligible for account creation
- Optional: Email notification sent to user (if implemented)

**Technical Details**:
- Manual process in Firebase Console
- Admin updates `status` field in waitlist document
- Firestore security rules allow admin modifications

### Phase 5: Account Creation After Approval

**User Action**: User attempts login again
- User returns to website
- User tries to login (still fails - account not created yet)
- User attempts account creation

**System Response**:
- Login fails with "Account not activated" or similar message
- Account creation now allowed for approved waitlist users
- User successfully creates account

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Account creation validation
// Check if user email is in approved waitlist
const checkWaitlistApproval = async (email: string) => {
  const waitlistDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'waitlist', hashedEmail));
  return waitlistDoc.exists() && waitlistDoc.data().status === 'approved';
}
```

**Database Changes**:
```
users/
├── {userId}
│   ├── email: "user@example.com"
│   ├── tier: "FREE"
│   ├── createdAt: Timestamp
│   ├── lastLogin: Timestamp
│   ├── usageCount: 0
│   ├── freeTrialStartDate: Timestamp
│   └── freeTrialEndDate: Timestamp (4 weeks later)
```

### Phase 6: Free User Period (4 Weeks)

**User Experience**:
- User logged in successfully
- Access to limited FREE tier features
- Usage tracking and limitations enforced
- 4-week trial period begins

**System Behavior**:
- User tier set to "FREE"
- Usage limits enforced per tier model system
- Free trial countdown begins
- Limited access to AI models (gemini-2.5-flash-lite)

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Tier-based feature access
const modelConfig = {
  audioTranscription: 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite',
  expertChat: 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite',
  emailComposition: 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite',
  analysisGeneration: 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite',
  // ... other features with lite model
}
```

### Phase 7: Daily Usage

**User Action**: User returns next day
- User logs in successfully
- User accesses available features
- User experiences FREE tier limitations

**System Response**:
- Successful login
- Usage tracking continues
- Feature access based on FREE tier limits
- Gentle prompts about upgrade options

### Phase 8: Subscription Upgrade

**User Action**: User decides to upgrade
- User navigates to pricing page
- User selects Silver subscription
- User proceeds to payment

**System Flow**:
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Silver"
2. Redirect to payment processor (Stripe)
3. User completes payment
4. Stripe webhook triggers subscription activation
5. User tier updated to "SILVER"
6. Enhanced features unlocked

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Webhook handling in netlify/functions
export const handler = async (event) => {
  // Verify Stripe webhook signature
  // Parse subscription data
  // Update user tier in Firestore
  await updateDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId), {
    tier: 'SILVER',
    subscriptionId: subscription.id,
    subscriptionStatus: 'active',
    upgradeDate: new Date()
  });
}
```

**Database Changes**:
```
users/{userId}
├── tier: "SILVER" (updated)
├── subscriptionId: "sub_xxxxx"
├── subscriptionStatus: "active"
├── upgradeDate: Timestamp
└── paymentMethod: object
```

### Phase 9: Silver User Experience

**Enhanced Features**:
- Better AI models for key functions
- Increased usage limits
- Priority support access
- Advanced analytics features

**Model Configuration**:
```typescript
// SILVER tier models
{
  audioTranscription: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  analysisGeneration: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  pptExport: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  businessCase: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  generalAnalysis: 'gemini-2.5-flash'
}
```

### Phase 10: Subscription Management

**User Action**: User manages subscription
- User navigates to "Instellingen" (Settings) page
- User accesses subscription management section
- User chooses to cancel subscription

**System Response**:
- Display current subscription details
- Show cancellation options
- Process cancellation request
- Schedule downgrade for end of billing period

### Phase 11: Subscription Cancellation

**User Action**: User confirms cancellation
- User clicks "End Subscription"
- User confirms cancellation decision

**System Process**:
1. Cancellation request sent to Stripe
2. Stripe webhook confirms cancellation
3. User subscription marked for end-of-period cancellation
4. User receives confirmation message
5. Subscription remains active until period end
6. User automatically downgraded to FREE tier

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Cancellation webhook handling
export const handleSubscriptionCancellation = async (subscription) => {
  await updateDoc(doc(db, 'users', userId), {
    subscriptionStatus: 'canceled',
    cancelDate: new Date(),
    downgradePendingDate: new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000),
    tier: 'SILVER' // Remains until period end
  });
  
  // Schedule automatic downgrade
  // Send confirmation email with end date
}
```

**User Notification**:
- Confirmation message displayed
- Email sent with cancellation details
- End date clearly communicated
- Information about FREE tier fallback

### Phase 12: Fallback to Free Plan

**Automatic Process**: At subscription end date
- User tier automatically changed to "FREE"
- Access restricted to FREE tier features
- Account remains active
- User data preserved

**Database Changes**:
```
users/{userId}
├── tier: "FREE" (downgraded)
├── subscriptionStatus: "ended"
├── downgradeDate: Timestamp
├── previousTier: "SILVER"
└── accountStatus: "active" (preserved)
```
